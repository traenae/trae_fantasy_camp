The river Amhert starts high in the backbone and rushes for several miles in a winding valley before falling several feet to gradually grow into a wide slow moving river. The river empties into the western sea after joining with another smaller river. The channel is navigable up to the  [[Cataract_Dowry|Dowry Falls]].
