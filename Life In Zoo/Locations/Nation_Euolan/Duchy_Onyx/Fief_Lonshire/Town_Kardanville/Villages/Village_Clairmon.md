The Village of Clairmon sits atop a flattened hill. In ages past, the hill was flattened by settlers to use as a hill fort. The earthen walls were replaced by a wooden palisade, then more recently by a wall of stone and masonry. The village is surrounded by dense woods. Instead of farming, the village cultivates forest edibles like berries, mushrooms, and edible roots for sustenance and for trade. Artisans specializing in woodcrafts are quite numerous and their exports account for most trade with other communities.
