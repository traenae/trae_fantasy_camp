Shandar cave is a recently discovered system of caves and caverns. It is occupied by refugees of various races forced out of the depths by encroaching monsters. In ages past, there was an entrance to the surface, but several hundred years ago, shortly after being setup as a hill fort, the cave mouth collapsed.

The refugees have just cleared the collapse, and want some adventurous young people to investigate the area surrounding the cave mouth. 

The cave mouth is situated on the south side of [[Village_Clairmon|Clairmon Hill]]. The villagers had no previous knowledge of the cave system, and will be surprised by anyone emerging from it.
