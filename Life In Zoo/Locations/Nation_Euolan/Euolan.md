### Geography

Euolan is an island kingdom off the coast of a large continent. It it feudal in nature. The kingdom is broken into three Duchies. Each duchy contains several fiefdoms. The head vassal of each fiefdom is a Count. Each Count oversees 1 to 5 towns headed by an earl. Every earl has at leas 3 barons under him/her. These barons oversee a village. Villages contain a small keep, a market square, and several homes. The keep, market, and homes are within a palisade, or wall. The villages are surrounded by fields. Forests, heaths, marshes, or rivers divide one village from another, though some have only a rock wall to mark the boundary.

The northern third of Euolan is cool, with many hills and low mountains creating numerous valleys and lochs. The mountains from the northern part of Euolan continue south to form a ridge which reaches just over the border of the southern region. 

In the center third of the island, broad plateaus slope toward the coast. These plateaus are covered in grassy heaths of heather, broom, and sage near the backbone. The heaths give way to dense mixed forests broken only by the many villages that dot the region. Along the coast and inland a few miles marshes and grassy plains dominate the uncultivated areas.

The southern third of the island slopes gently toward the coast, where cliffs of several yards in height are frequent. The area is lightly forested with deciduous trees dominating. Grassy plains, a few marshes near rivers or streams, and shallow valleys create a large productive area with a large population.

The southern thirds of the island is very temperate with temperatures warming toward the south. Typical summer temperatures along the south coast are between 78 and 84 degrees Fahrenheit.


### Politics

Euolan is ruled by a king or queen. The previous ruler designates the most competent person from their offspring, or in the case of a childless monarch, their close relatives, to be the ruler. The chosen successor will designate the three most trusted siblings to rule over each duchy. Upon the death of the ruler, the head of each duchy must step down to allow the new duke or duchess to take over. The old leader of the duchy will be given the option of heading a manor (a vacant plantation), staying in the duchy capital as advisor and courtier, given a vacant mansion in a town or village, settling in a monastery, or leaving the duchy.

Children of the ruler who are not chosen to rule may become priests, artisans, or married to foreign kingdoms as part of alliances or treaties. Arranged marriages are not supposed to be forced, but may be strongly encouraged.

The current king is [[Arduke|King Arduke]].
