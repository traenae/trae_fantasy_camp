The PCs start in [[Shandar Cave|Shandar Cave]]. Their parents are refugees fleeing from monsters that overrun the [[Underdark|Underdark]]. Any race may be present among the refugees. The cave is currently occupied by about 42 families of various races. So 173 people, a little over half are children and youths under 16 (or racial equivalent).

Recently, the people of [[Shandar Cave|Shandar Cave]] started to clear out the mouth of the cave in an effort to reach the surface and possibly find more resources and a place to actually settle.

The Campaign Timeline will start shortly after the cave mouth is cleared enough for people to exit. The PCs are ““voluntold” to investigate the areas surrounding the cave for resources, inhabitants, and a possible spot for a more permanent settlement. The hill drops off quite precipitously, thus not suited for a settlement. 

PCs will have limited access to starting equipment. Leather armor is not available, but chain and plate are. Also padded cloth, and silk armor is available. No wooden, or mostly wooden weapons. Crossbows made of metal and composite materials yes, but long and short bows no. Swords, daggers, axes, yes. Quarterstaff, Nunchakus, no. 

Clothing, backpacks, pouches and the like will be various types of silk, or waxed silk. Food is “mystery meat”, insects, and fungi. Any of which can be dried into rations. Alcohol is made from fungi. Nothing dairy is available. Eggs are from insects and fish, not birds.

All PCs, regardless of race, have darkvision. Their families have been underground for centuries. While mundane and magical sources of light are available where necessary, much of the time is spent without much light. The PCs emerge into a dense forest. Only from about 10 am until about 2 pm is the light outside bright enough to cause problems. A *Con* check is required to see who is affected to the point of penalties. **DC 12** to avoid a -2 penalty on attack, saves, and skills/proficiencies. Roll each day until the check succeeds.

When the PCs start out, they will not know which animals are benign critters and which are dangerous monsters. Also, which plants are toxic and which are edible. They will be able to identify edible, toxic, and psychoactive fungi.

The starting area has a wide variety of fauna including deer, rabbits, chipmunks, lynx, wild cats, fox, wolves, small bears, badgers, wild dogs, song birds, hawks, owls, vultures, lizards, snakes, frogs, toads, turtles, cold freshwater fish, and eels. Numerous types of arthropods including beetles of various sorts, flies, dragonflies, spiders, ticks, scorpions, ants, wasps, bees, millipedes, centipedes, and many more.

Flora include things found in a mixed forest. Pine, cedar, maple, oak, walnut, chestnut, apple, pear and willow trees. Various cool temperate flowering plants, ferns, tubers, and bushes.

The Players should act as if everything was new. They have never seen actual wood, rather something similar made using dried fungi. No green plants, rather blue, purple and red “plants” that use bacteria and bioluminescant light for growth.

The PCs are also used to a consistent temperature and have adapted to 55 degrees Fahrenheit being “comfortable”. The PCs emerge in mid spring so fluctuations from 45 degrees to 60 degrees is typical. Underground clothing was optional. Warriors and guards wore protective armor, otherwise it was purely aesthetic. Needing clothing to regulate temperature, and for modesty would be a foreign concept.

They have heard tales of the sun, but have never seen it. Or a moon. In this land, the sun does not “move”, but rather it brightens, dims, and disappears for a few hours before brightening again. There are 4 “moons”. They seem to move, but don’t have phases. Months are determined by the position of the moons, and years by the changing of the seasons. Otherwise seasons, weather, and tides are similar to Earth.
