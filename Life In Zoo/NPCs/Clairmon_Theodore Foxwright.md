Ted is a hunter specializing in melee using swords, spears, or fists. He and his sister, [[Clairmon_Jillian Foxwright|Jill]], grew-up in the care of the Poor Master because their father was caught stealing coins from a merchant and made a slave, and their mother was deemed an habitual drunk and sent to a convent and was never heard from again.
