Clairice traveled to [[Village_Clairmon|Clairmon Village]] a couple of years ago as part of a caravan. The dwarf is excellent at healing magic, and using potions she personally crafted to aid others. She has taken a fancy to [[Clairmon_Kalvin Oxwain|Kalvin]]. She is trying to convince him and the Foxwright twins to join the [[Questing Guild|Questing Guild]]. While she likes [[Village_Clairmon|Clairmon]], she wouldnâ€™t mind traveling around the county to help others and make some money.
