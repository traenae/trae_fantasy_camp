Jill is an archer and tracker specializing in large game. She and her brother, [[Clairmon_Theodore Foxwright|Ted]], grew-up in the care of the Poor Master because their father was caught stealing coins from a merchant and made a slave, and their mother was deemed an habitual drunk and sent to a convent and was never heard from again.
