# trae_fantasy_camp
Come up with a fantasy campaign for friends/family.

plan on using Obsidian for campaign structure and Roll20 to actually play. Not sure about the system right now. I can sketch out the superstructure without a specific system in mind.
I will back up everything here so I can work on it wherever and be sure it is saved securely.
