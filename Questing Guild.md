An organization that recruits, organizes, and supports individuals and small parties of people capable of performing a variety of tasks. Tasks can be a simple as collecting plants in the forest, ridding vermin from a basement, helping move heavy boxes, to complex as killing dangerous animals or monsters causing problems for a village. Some quests involve traveling between villages within a county, or over long distances. Such quests usually are to escort a caravan, or group of pilgrims.

The Guild rateâ€™s the quests as E, D, C, B, A, or S. Adventurers are rated using the same system. An individual can only undertake quests of their rank or lower. Groups of three or more can undertake a job of up to one rank higher than the group average.

E = 1 - 3, D = 4 - 8, C = 9 - 13, B = 14 - 16, A = 17 - 20, S = 21+

E = harvesting in local area, ridding homes of large vermin, hunting small game, fetch and carry tasks, escorting groups over established generally safe routes.

D = harvesting deeper in wild areas, assist local militia in peacekeeping, assist local militia in guarding the settlement, hunting larger game, moving bulky items, escorting groups over established routes prone to petty bandits or low-level raiders.

C = harvesting in dangerous wilderness areas, assisting regional army in repelling monsters or invaders, decreasing hostile groups, investigating ruins, cave systems, or other potentially dangerous areas, assisting magic users in experiments, escorting groups between settlements without an established route, or with a route prone to raiders and dangerous bandits.

B = gathering rare and/or dangerous items from the [[Underdark|Underdark]] or war zones, assisting armies in battle, overthrow dangerous or incompetent nobles, assisting magic users or cleric in dangerous experiments, escorting groups between settlements without established routes that go through dangerous wildernesses.

A = gathering rare and/or dangerous items from other nations or realms, assisting a monarch in regime change, undertaking sensitive negotiations between nations or realms, assisting magic-users or clerics in research across realms or planes, escorting groups between or across realms or non-lethal planes.

S = perform heroic (or villainous) stuff that affects entire realms or lesser planes.
